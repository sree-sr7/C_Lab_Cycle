# C_Lab_Cycle
A repo to store all Sem 1 MCA DS Lab programs
1. Write programs to demonstrate the use of storage classes (local variable, global
variable, static variable, register variable) in C.
2. Use a menu-driven program to insert, search, delete and sort elements in an array
using functions (use global variables)
3. Use a menu-driven program to insert, search, delete and sort elements in an array
using functions (use only local variables)
4. Search for all the occurrences of an element in an integer array (positions)
5. Sort the array elements in ascending order (minimum three functions: read, disp and
sort)
6. Display the array elements in the same order using a recursive function
7. Display array elements in reverse order using a recursive function .
8. Write a program to Perform the addition of two matrix and Subtraction of one
matrix from another
9. Write a program to perform multiplication of two matrix
10. Write a program to find the transpose of a matrix
11. Write a program to find the Determinant of a matrix (2x2 and 3x3)
Section 2: Stack
12. Implement stack operations using arrays

Session 3 - String
13. Read a String and Just print it in the reverse order
14. Read a String and Reverse the string in the same array itself
15. Read n Strings and display them in the ascending order.

Session 4 - Stack .. Continued
16. Reverse a string using Stack
